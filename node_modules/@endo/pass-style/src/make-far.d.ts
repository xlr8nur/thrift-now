 * The name of the automatically added default meta-method for obtaining a

 * inherits from an object declared with `Far`.

 * Modeled on `GET_INTERFACE_GUARD` from `@endo/exo`.
 *
 * TODO Name to be bikeshed. Perhaps even whether it is a
 * string or symbol to be bikeshed. See
 * https://github.com/endojs/endo/pull/1809#discussion_r1388052454
 *
 * HAZARD: Beware that an exo's interface can change across an upgrade,
 * so remotes that cache it can become stale.
