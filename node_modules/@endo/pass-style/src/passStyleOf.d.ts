 * If there is already a PassStyleOfEndowmentSymbol property on the global,

 * function, so we should use and export that one instead.
 * Other software may have left it for us here,
 * but it would require write access to our global, or the ability to
 * provide endowments to our global, both of which seems adequate as a test of
 * whether it is authorized to serve the same role as liveslots.
 *
 * NOTE HAZARD: This use by liveslots does rely on `passStyleOf` being
 * deterministic. If it is not, then in a liveslot-like virtualized
 * environment, it can be used to detect GC.
